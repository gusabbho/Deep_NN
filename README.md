# Deep_NN
there are three main files in this repesitory "basic_DNN_classification_and_regression" which shows how basically DNN work as classifier or regressor.
"challenges_with_hyperparameters" is a usefull notebook including techniques to assign proper hyperparameters to avoid vanishing gradient, overfitting and other challenges might be encountered when model is training.
"CNN" notebook includes basics and some pretrained models for convolutional NN.
overall these three files can be used as a cheatsheet to construct the layers and assign hypereparameters which can improve the model's training process. 
I made some sample models in mini-project file in this repository.
